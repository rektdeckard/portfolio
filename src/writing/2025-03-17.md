I find it ironic that Elon Musk named one of SpaceX's drone ships (the "Of Course I Still Love You") after a starship in a book (*The Player of Games* by Iain M. Banks) in which the humans of the galactic society frequently change their gender just for the experience of it, and there is only a single genderless pronoun for all sentient species. Oh and the main baddies are an alien race with 3 genders.
