        <p>
          qMind is a research platform for building a more individual model of
          intelligence and mental fitness via language. The core concept is that
          ideas are defined in relation to one another; words can only be
          defined in terms of other words, therefore our understanding can be
          represented by a directed graph of word meanings. By asking people to
          define different phrases in their own terms, we build a weighted
          network of meaning and word association.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current language models are based on statistical prediction methods,
          whereby vast amounts of text are analyzed in advance to form a
          weighted graph of their likelihood to appear near each other in a
          sentence. These transformers have an incredible capacity to imitate
          complex and intelligent behavior.

          One of the requirements was that the portal be not only a means for
          collecting data, but also serve as an exploration tool for both
          participants and researchers to look deeply into the data. This meant
          having interactive data visualizations, search, sort, filter and
          transforms of the underlying data, and realtime analysis on it.

          I implemented algorithms and related visualizations for common graph

          Providing these slices of information on-the-fly is a tough target to
          hit. The datasets generated by a single session are relatively small,
          but the analysis on them could be potentially massive. Some tasks lent
          themselves strongly toward client-side calculation on a per-user
          basis, and others toward batch or cron jobs on tables or entire
          databases. That's why we went with a GraphQL-based communication
          layer, and a hybrid mode of analysis where work was split between
          server and client, depending on what significance and scope it had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding path lengths between specific nodes, for example, could be
          done on demand by the client, since it would be relevant only at that
          time. Calculating the graph's Eigenvector centralities, on the other
          hand, would be precomputed by batch processes.
        </p>
        <Heading id="whats-next">What's next?</Heading>
        <p>
          The platform will use participant datasets to build language models
          that are both generalizable, and tuneable. Eventually, the plan is to
          use the model to help identify cognitive deficiencies in youth and
          elderly, to recommend areas of focus for school-aged children, and
          potentially as an early-warning indicator for neurological disease.

          When you make a commitment with Hey You, we'll send you a reminder
          once a month, at the time and date of your choice, to call that
          person. If you have to cancel, or don't feel like it, you donate $5 to
          one of our charity partners working to combat loneliness, social

          We needed a site to serve as the face for Hey You, which would allow
          users to make a commitment and get info about the project and partner
          charities. We needed a means to send reminders, and hold people to
          their commitments. And we wanted the experience to seem light and
          unintrusive, with no app to download or account to create.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the reminders, SMS seemed an obvious choice to keep
          communication lightweight ‚Äî everyone has it, and there's nothing to
          download! We decided that once a user had initiated a commitment, we
          would pick up the process over text, and all further interaction would
          be through this channel.

          Our phones are basically digital drugs. Colorful app icons, badges and
          notifications vying for our attention at every minute. It's tough to
          resist, and I'd be the first to admit I have a problem. So when I
          discovered that with an Android phone and some special tools I could
          entirely replace the addictive homescreen paradigm with whatever I
          could dream up, I decided to make something that would, hopefully,
          help institute some harm-reduction with in phone habits. And maybe
          look kinda cool in the process.

          While the framework API exposes some device vitals and notifications,
          generating the map view and nearby transit visualizations was a bit
          more of a challenge. I relied on Google's{" "}

            GTFS Realtime
          </a>{" "}
          REST APIs to put it all together. For the map, we would construct a
          complex query using device GPS coordinates and user-set variables like
          the current dashboard theme and map zoom level, request a static map
          image with the appropriate style parameters, then apply
          post-processing and layer it into the dashboard UI.

          The transit stations would be a bit simpler, requiring just a simple
          API query and some parsing of the response, before displaying the
          transit modes on screen. Both the map and transit components could be
          customized to deep-link into the preferred navigation app with some of
          the navigation context pre-filled.

          Smart home lighting is pretty great. The ability to set the mood for a
          horror movie, gaming session, or party is a new level of immersion.
          And hey, our screens change color temperature to protect our eyes and
          sleep patterns, so why shouldn't the lights in our houses?
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Controlling</i> your smart lights, however, is another story. When
          I installed Philips Hue bulbs in my apartment, my initial awe was
          followed shortly by the realization that 'smart' is a relative term. I
          couldn't touch the wall switches if I wanted the bulbs to stay
          connected. It always felt like a <i>process</i> to simply dim the
          lights as I worked late into the evening. The desktop apps for
          managing them were bloated, and my phone was...across the room. I
          started wondering, could my smart lights and sensors be controlled
          from a web app? The answer was Yes. Sort of.

          Enter stage right, Huebert, my idea for a web and desktop client for
          Philips Hue lighting and home automation. It would provide a clean and
          lightweight interface to adjust your lights directly from the browser.
          As far as I knew, it would be the only browser-based app of its kind.
          As it would turn out, there may be a reason for that.

          (account creation required) is thorough and flush with specifications
          and examples, and shows Philips' deep commitment to making an
          ecosystem of hackable and open products. They actively welcome
          development of third-party hardware and software, and even have a
          lengthy section on light and color theory in the developer pages.

        <p>
          The Hue Bridge operates a local webserver on your WiFi network that
          listens to requests at several endpoints, providing control of
          everything from individual lights to scheduling lighting changes to
          customizing the behavior and triggers of connected switches and
          sensors. Commands use a declarative language that allow you to
          describe the state a light or element should be in, and the Bridge
          handles transitioning to that state.

          I chose to scaffold out a web application in React, since the
          declarative nature of the framework seemed a good fit for the API.
          Talking to the Bridge via the RESTful interface was a breeze, and
          building an interface around such inherently colorful data was a joy.{" "}

          To move fast, I leaned on the{" "}
          <a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a> toolkit for
          basic interface components. Other components were custom-made to fit

          Since I was on a roll, I figured why not port the project to a
          multiplatform Electron app as well. No internet access? No problem! A
          desktop app could talk to your lights without leaving the local
          network.

        <p>
          The first working web-app build was deployed after a week or two via
          GitHub Pages. Difficulties arose when I realized that:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Hue Bridge does not expose an encrypted endpoint.</li>
          <li>
            Modern browsers <i>really</i> don't like it when web content from
            encrypted sources (HTTPS) make requests to unencrypted (HTTP)
            destinations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Philips <i>does</i> provide a Remote API that handles unencrypted
            traffic without routing communication through the browser, but it
            requires additional setup. Messages travel over the internet rather
            than the local network, and therefore incur additional latency.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          People were visiting the site, attempting to link to their Hue Bridge,
          and getting console errors about an <code>Invalid Certificate</code>.
          Their browsers were refusing to talk to unencrypted endpoints, since
          the origin itself was encrypted ‚Äî also known as{" "}
          <code>Mixed Content</code>. Chrome and other browsers allow you to
          circumvent this protection, but not without blasting you with some
          pretty scary-looking warnings:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <source srcSet={cert_warning_webp} type="image/webp" />

          <figcaption>
            Scary Chrome warning that a site's certificate is not trusted
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Thankfully, this issue wasn't present in the Electron version of the
          app, since it would be running on a host machine on the local network.
          Foregoing encryption in this context is fine, since the traffic never
          leaves your house.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did the math, and decided the compromise of asking users to
          occasionally consent to a scary warning (every time the browser is
          updated or the cache is cleared) while posing litte real security risk
          was better than the alternatives ‚Äî hosting the web-app itself on an
          unencrypted domain and sending all communication in-the-clear, or
          using the Remote API and requiring a more complicated setup on the
          user's part.

        <p>
          Browsers protect us from the vast majority of malicious actors out
          there, as well as much of our own unsafe behavior. Though working
          within their security restrictions can present challenges in
          edge-cases like this one, I'm glad to have them. At least I now know a
          lot more about the inner workings of{" "}

          Ultimately I was able to provide myself, as well as a creative

        <p>
          My partner Helena and I have a soft spot for the early days of the
          internet, when sites were unique, experimental, and performant. We
          wanted to build her a portfolio that was all of these things ‚Äî but
          with modern web conventions at the core: responsive design, lazy
          loading, interactions that felt dynamic and tactile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helena put together a design inspired by newspapers, with dense
          columns of content and explicit hierarchies of information. We mixed
          in references to broadcast TV and other analog media to make an
          experience that felt simultaneously nostalgic and modern.

          I knew that using a popular framework like React or Vue.js went
          against the vibe for the site. It had to load fast, in mere kilobytes,
          and degrade gracefully in cases of poor bandwidth or lack of
          JavaScript ‚Äî none of which are possible with typical SPAs today. This
          would be a regular old HTML/CSS/JS site. But since it's not 2003 any
          more, it needed to have some panache, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since most of the content would follow a grid-like pattern, I first
          laid out a scaffold using CSS <code>grid</code> layouts. After some
          experimentation with different breakpoints (mobile in particular), I
          pivoted to a <code>flexbox</code> based layout to simplify things. I
          borrowed some ideas (and code) from the{" "}
          <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> CSS framework to achieve good
          reusability on the column components.

          A requirement of the portfolio site was that is should be simple
          enough for Helena to update herself with new content and projects.
          HTML5 Semantic Elements helped make the markup read like an outline,
          and massively aided comprehension. No <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup
          for you!

          Perhaps the two greatest benefits to this approach are the impressive
          gains to accessibility (screen readers and assistive devices have a
          much easier time of parsing this type of document), and the boost it
          gives to webpage SEO and indexing.

        </figure>
        <p>
          The design included a small block of TV static at the foot of the
          page; a purely aesthetic element that was originally intended to be a
          simple image. For fun, I decided to make it dynamic and wrote a white
          noise generator and spit the results onto a{" "}
          <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element, to great nostalgic effect. The
          first, na√Øve pass used the Canvas API methods <code>fillRect()</code>{" "}
          and <code>clearRect()</code>, looping through the canvas coordinates
          and painting 1x1 'pixels' randomly in black or white. Since painting
          on a canvas is additive, each frame also had to clear the canvas
          before painting into it again. It was terribly slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          With some research into optimal data structures in JavaScript, and
          some performance testing of my own, I came up with a solution that
          didn't require clearing the canvas, and only needed one paint call per
          frame (instead of one per pixel!). Using a <code>Uint32Array</code> as
          a shared buffer for both the white noise values and the{" "}
          <code>ImageData</code> itself, we would fill the typed array with
          32-bit integers representing transparent black (all <code>0</code>{" "}
          bits) or solid white (all <code>1</code> bits) at random, then paint
          this <code>ImageData</code> in one go with <code>putImageData()</code>
          . The canvas itself was given a black background that peeked through
          the transparent pixels.

          As a further optimization, I turned to the browser's built-in{" "}
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto">
            Crypto API{" "}
          </a>
          to get random bits even faster, with less overhead. The{" "}
          <code>window.crypto</code> object exposes a single method,{" "}
          <code>getRandomValues(typedArray)</code>, which will fill a passed{" "}
          <code>TypedArray</code> with cryptographically strong random bits via
          a PRNG seeded by a system-level entropy source. Similar to how we went
          from <code>n</code> paint events down to <code>1</code>, we were now
          getting our random bits wholesale.
        </p>
        <Callout>
          <p>
            <strong>NB:</strong> requesting more than 65,536 bits at a time from{" "}
            <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues()</code> will throw a{" "}
            <code>QuotaExceededError</code>, due to minimum guaranteed entropy
            of seed values. If more bits are needed, the buffer can be filled,
            used, and filled again.
          </p>
        </Callout>
        <p>
          There are certainly less CPU-intensive ways to create the visual
          effect of TV static: precomputing more noise than needed and choosing
          a random index into the noise to start painting from each frame, or
          even just using a GIF. But the fact that this implementation is truly
          (pseudo)random each frame and still manages to maintain 60 FPS is
          pretty unique.

          When I sat down to build this, I was expecting a familiar exercise in
          static site development. Through the process of playing around with a
          seemingly mundane aesthetic element, though, I discovered quite a bit
          about browser APIs, and learned to look for solutions in unexpected
          places. By architecting the site for future modification and code
          readability, we got some excellent side-benefits. The end result was
          exactly the type of experience we wanted to create at the start. And
          we brought this thing from a sketch to production in one week flat.

          A few years ago I made the switch from iPhone to Android. I wanted to

          around 40 custom, minimal icons to replace the common utility app
          icons and fit in with the hacker aesthetic.

          , replacing icons for over 800 of the most common apps with clean,
          minimalistic, monochromatic glyphs. We released different colorways,
          took icon suggestions, got involved in the small but active community
          of phone customizers. Helena even wrote{" "}

          Taking advantage of React's <code>Context API</code> and Vue's{" "}
          <code>provide/inject</code> feature, I brought stateful local and
          global styling to the icon components. You could set the appearance of
          all icons in a subtree from one place, but unlike CSS it could be
          dynamic and manipulated programmatically.

          When working with large component libraries, it's important to factor
          out sources of human error. Mistakes crop up inevitably at scale, and
          with over 3,500 icons and their corresponding implementations ‚Äî
          packages in 3 javascript frameworks, a Figma plugin and library, and
          other things I'm forgetting ‚Äî we had a lot of complexity to manage by
          hand. This led me to build custom internal tooling to support our
          efforts from the design process all the way through to production,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An{" "}

            </a>{" "}
            to check visual size and consistency of new icons against known
            controls
          </li>
          <li>A custom SVG sanitizer to slim down our asset sizes</li>
          <li>Codegen for 99.5% of our framework-specific library code</li>
          <li>
            Macro tools for Figma that handle some assembly of the design
            resources
          </li>
          <li>Build-scripts to tie it all together</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A small battery of unit and integration tests ensured that our
          automated approach wouldn't propagate subtle bugs throughout the
          system. And at the end of it all, we generated example apps to allow
          thorough inspection of every icon with the good ol'{" "}
          <i title="A.K.A. looking at it.">Mark I Eyeball‚Ñ¢</i>. This usually
          consisted of large contact-sheets with multiple instances of each icon
          in its many variants and sizes, arranged to visually highlight
          inconsistencies.

            Aside from reducing carpal tunnel risks for my partner and myself,
            the automation and testing processes gave us a confidence we
            couldn't get doing all of this manually.

          Naturally, we needed a fun and functional site to house the project.
          We wanted a searchable interface for the icon library that showcased
          each icon variant, along with code snippets for developers to quickly
          reference. And to show off a bit with sleek, snappy animations and
          strong visual demonstrations of the icons in use.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took it as an opportunity to try out some new tools in the React
          ecosystem. TypeScript formed the foundation for less buggy code with
          more compile-time guarantees. I used{" "}
          <a href="https://recoiljs.org/">Recoil</a>, a new experimental state
          management library from Facebook. It is an absolute joy to work with,
          and eliminates hundreds of lines of Redux boilerplate. I implemented a
          smart client-size fuzzy search with help from the awesome{" "}
          <a href="https://fusejs.io/">Fuse.js</a> library, making searching for
          icons much more forgiving.

          In my weekend forays into embedded systems, I came up with the idea to
          build a dedicated hardware system resource monitor to always show the
          CPU, Memory, and I/O utilization of my computer in a beautiful
          phyisical device. Who doesn't like a retro techy gadget?
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial design used a simple 4 character 14-segment amber LED
          display and an Adafruit Feather HUZZAH microcontroller for the brains.
          It alternated showing the current CPU and Memory usage in percent,
          collecting performance data using the{" "}

          library, and streaming the data over the UART in a bespoke text
          format. It only worked on Windows and was pretty finnicky, but it was
          damn cool.

          It fit nicely on my desk, and I was happy with it, for a time. But I
          soon wanted more information: disk and network I/O, histograms to
          visualize the statistics over time. I also wanted a robust CLI with
          backwards-compatibility for my original hardware, improved support for
          things like display update interval and display brightness, and the
          ability to run the host as a daemon so it could be started on boot
          with no interaction and run completely in the background.

        <Heading id="redesign">Redesign</Heading>
        <p>
          I chose a 128x32 pixel monochrome OLED display, and wrote a primitive
          but effective graphing library to render pretty histograms. The end
          result looked something like this:

          The memory limitation led me to implement a simple Ring Buffer to
          store chronological data and to write and read efficiently without
          allocation. This also resulted in quite simple rendering code.
