## Exploration for the sake of it

As a self-taught developer, I have always been at least a little insecure about my formal skills in computer science. Sure, at the end of the day what matters is what you can build with the skills you have -- and I'm no slouch with practical skills. But I recently became interested in developing some of the more esoteric muscles around programming, those to do with mathematics, algorithms, and data structures.

What set me off was learning about the K-dimensional Tree, a time-efficient data structure for searching higher-dimensional datasets. Inspired by Mike Pound's [Computerphile Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK5x7IUTIyU) I decided to implement one from first principles.

<KdimJuliaPixel
  stride={5}
  domain={1}
  scale={3}
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>

TKTK

<KdimNoise stride={5} type="Simplex" freq={3} rate={0.01} width={400} height={400} />
