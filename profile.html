              <p>Hi, my name is Tobias and I'm a mobile engineer and former film industry professional. In my free time I enjoy backpacking, photography, and brewing kombucha and other fermented foods.</p>
              <p>Throughout my career as a Location Scout and Manager in the film and television industry, I had the pleasure to work with some amazing talents, and to develop skills that I consider some of my most valuable today. I learned to be effective in an agile work environment with demanding time constraints (shooting schedules are a complex time-optimization problem in and of themselves). To approach tough logistical problems one step at a time, while keeping the overall goal in clear focus. And to balance the needs of stakeholder groups -- from creators and producers, to city governments and law enforcement, to the residents and property owners whose neighborhoods we filmed in.</p>
              <p>Over time I realized that the most valuable resource we have is time itself, and I made it my unofficial mission on any project to maximize that time available. I wrote scripts to convert, scale, and post batches of location photos to save countless hours of manual data entry, and shared them with my colleagues. Pushed for the adoption of team communication services in an industry where most things are still done over fragmented email threads. Implemented better budget and labor tracking systems in Excel. Eventually I realized that solving problems like these was one of the most rewarding parts of my job.</p>
              <p>Less than a year ago, thanks to this realization, I left the film world to pursue software engineering full-time. After completing the Google/Udacity nanodegree certificate program in Android Development, I started working on an app to help me keep track of the innumerable fermentation projects I had sitting my kitchen counter. This was, after all, another problem to be optimized with software, and I found that no tool out there could do exactly what I needed. Along the way, I challenged myself to learn new tools and technologies like Kotlin and Google Cloud Services, implement design patterns to make code cleaner, leaner, and easier to debug. I took on side projects, collaborating with a designer to release several home screen theming and customization apps on the Google Play Store. Above all, I discovered that I had found a way to put my passion for problem solving to use.</p>
              <p>I believe that good software has the power to give us back the time to do the most important things in life, and I want to learn from the experience of like-minded people and to be a part of creating it.</p>
